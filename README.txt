Description:
The GitHub Job application allows you to search, and view jobs using several parameters:
1. description — A search term, such as "ruby" or "java". This parameter is aliased to search
2. location — A city name, zip code, or other location search term
3. full_time — If you want to limit results to full time positions set this parameter to 'true'
